# Orbitals

Title ID `040032B023CA4000`, update v327680. Added automatically when [nxnative](https://github.com/seedds/nxnative) added its profile: see [nxnative's notes on it](https://github.com/seedds/nxnative/tree/f7096458da98adcae46dc1a4b5e9c9ca07d778b9/dm/games/040032B023CA4000) for how far it plays and on which Mac.

Built with nxnative's own builder at the commit `game.json` names (fetched once into `./engines`), with Hermit's front end added (`tools/engine/patch.py`): the game starts at once, **key 1** is the performance overlay and **key 2** the settings.

## Shared shader list

[`shader_list.tsv`](shader_list.tsv): this game's own list of shaders and pipelines players have met, for this engine version only. It starts empty: when you close the game, the app offers to send what it built.

## How it runs on players' Macs

[`reports.tsv`](reports.tsv): every report that names the Mac. Tell others how it ran with the [How it ran](https://github.com/azmasm/hermit/issues/new?template=how-it-ran.yml) form.

## Build

In the Hermit app: choose your dump folder on the **Builds** page and press **Build**. In Terminal:

```bash
./hermit.py build "<your dump folder>"
```
